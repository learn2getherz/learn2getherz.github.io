[<Home |](../../../index.md)

### What is Python?
Python is a widely used high-level programming language that was first released in 1991. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a great language for beginners to learn. Despite its ease of use, Python is also a powerful language that can be used for complex projects and applications, including web development, data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The language has a large and active community, which provides developers with many resources and libraries. Overall, Python is a versatile and powerful language that is well-suited to a wide range of applications, and is a great language to learn for anyone interested in programming.

> Before diving into learning Python, it's important to have some basic knowledge of computer usage. This includes understanding how to use a keyboard and mouse, navigating through files and folders, and basic software installation. If you're new to using computers, it's recommended that you take some time to become comfortable with the basics before diving into learning Python. This will help you better understand the concepts and syntax used in Python programming.

### Installing Python
* Windows:
    * Go to the Python website and download the latest version of Python for Windows.
    * Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python on your computer.
    * Make sure to check the box that adds Python to your system path.

* Mac OS:
    * Go to the Python website and download the latest version of Python for Mac OS.
    * Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python on your computer.
    * You can also install Python using Homebrew, a popular package manager for Mac OS.

* Linux:
    * Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. To check if Python is already installed, open a terminal window and type python --version.
    * If Python is not already installed, use your distribution's package manager to install it. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the command sudo apt-get install python3 to install Python 3.

### Setting up an IDE
Once you have installed Python, you can open a command prompt or terminal window and type python to start the Python interpreter. This will allow you to write and run Python code directly from the command line.

If you want to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write Python code, there are many popular options available, including PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Spyder.
