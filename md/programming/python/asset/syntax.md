## Python Syntax
[<Home |](../../../../index.md) [<Back |](../python.md)


### Hello World

```
print("Hello, world!")
```

> When you run this code, it will print the text "Hello, world!" to the console. This is a simple but important first step in learning Python.

### Comment

* There are two types of comments in Python: single-line comments and multi-line comments.
    * Single-line comments begin with the hash symbol (#) and continue until the end of the line:
    ```
    # This is a single-line comment in Python
    ```
    * Multi-line comments, also known as block comments, are enclosed in triple quotes (""" """) or (''' ''') and can span multiple lines:
    ```
        """
        This is a multi-line comment
        in Python.
        It can span multiple lines.
        """
    ```

### Python Data Variables
* There are several types of variables in Python, including:    
    * Integer - Used to store whole numbers, for example: `x = 69`
    * Float - Used to store decimal numbers, for example: `y = 3.14`
    * Boolean - Used to store true or false values, for example: `is_love = True`
    * String - Used to store text values, for example: `name = "John"`
    * List - Used to store a collection of values, for example: `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
    * Tuple - Similar to lists, but the values are immutable (cannot be changed), for example: `coordinates = (1, 2)`
    * Dictionary - Used to store key-value pairs, for example: `person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}`

To assign a value to a variable, you can use the equal sign `(=)`. For example: `x = 5` assigns the `value 5` to the `variable x`. You can also change the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it: `x = 6` changes the value of `x` to `6`.
