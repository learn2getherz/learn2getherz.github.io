## Python Syntax
[<Home |](../../../../index.md) [<Back |](../python.md)


### Hello World

```
print("Hello, world!")
```

> When you run this code, it will print the text "Hello, world!" to the console. This is a simple but important first step in learning Python.

### Comment

* There are two types of comments in Python: single-line comments and multi-line comments.
    * Single-line comments begin with the hash symbol (#) and continue until the end of the line:
    ```
    # This is a single-line comment in Python
    ```
    * Multi-line comments, also known as block comments, are enclosed in triple quotes (""" """) or (''' ''') and can span multiple lines:
    ```
        """
        This is a multi-line comment
        in Python.
        It can span multiple lines.
        """
    ```
